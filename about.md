I've been a software engineer for 10+ years and love to talk shop. Currently I am a Developer Advocate for [Nuxeo](www.nuxeo.com) and previously worked in their Professional Services group for 4 years. I've worked on countless customer implementations and am really looking forward to sharing some of my knowledger with the greater community.

When I'm away from the computer, you will generally find me outside, somewhere in the world, and probably rock climbing.
