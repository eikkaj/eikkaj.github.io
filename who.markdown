New England grown, Jackie has been in the business for over 10 years. She loves bridging the gap between business and technology. 
When she isn't writing code, conducting training, or blogging, you'll probably find her outside rock climbing, skiing, or shooting photos.

OTR Digital Services was formed in response to the growing need for quality web development focused on local small businesses. 
Online presence is crucial to the success of nearly any business these days but that doesn't mean business owners should have to pay large heaps of money for
cookie cutter websites that are difficult to update and maintain. Additionally, we believe that technology as it applies to your business should be a collaborative effort,
that is built creatively and iteratively. 

There is no project too big or small, so please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:eikcaj.sweet@gmail.com">reach out</a>! Our interests lie particularly in green, local business. These days we are playing around with technology related to 
farming, farmers markets, and case management for ski patrol....for fun!
